                <h1><span>Ranked</span>: Yung Lean</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="description">
            <h3>
                Swedish artist Jonatan Leandoer, otherwise known to 
                listeners as Yung Lean, is certainly a polarizing 
                figure amongst music fans. It’s a difficult task to 
                put Lean in a box. His projects typically feature 
                dreary vocals supported by backgrounds of sometimes 
                metallic grunge, and other times dreamlike concoctions.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Despite what your stance might be regarding Lean’s 
                sound, there is no doubt that many contemporaries 
                have drawn upon him as an influence, either directly 
                or indirectly. With the release of the 25 year old’s 
                most recent mixtape, Stardust (which will remain 
                unranked for now), let’s take a closer look at Lean’s 
                entire discography and attempt to rank his projects 
                from worst to best.

                    <h3>
                        In short, Warlord is unhinged. This album was 
                        produced in the midst of manic hallucinations 
                        and spells of chaos that eventually sent Lean to 
                        the mental hospital. That energy manifests itself 
                        into a unbelievably raw musical experience. 
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the chaotic energy that is prevalent on 
                        the album, Warlord maintains balance. The synthesis
                        is a timeless album that I consider to be Lean’s 
                        best work. 
                        <br><br>
                        Songs that are worth checking out in 
                        particular include the wrathful “Hoover”, the 
                        unearthly “Miami Ultras”, and “Pearl Fountain” 
                        featuring Black Kray and Bladee.

                <a class="album-title" name="starz">Starz (2020)</a>

                    <h3>
                        Starz is arguably Yung Lean’s most cohesive work 
                        to date. The sixteen song album is sinister in tone, 
                        like a slow fog creeping into the bay. As the album 
                        progresses however, you can feel a shift where Lean 
                        finds liberation in the darkness rather than being 
                        consumed <br>by it like he once was. 
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the notable songs from 
                        this project include “Violence” and the opening 
                        track “My Agenda”. What holds this album back in 
                        terms of ranking has more to do with exemplary 
                        features of Lean’s other work and less to do with 
                        flaws within Starz.

                    <img src="assets/unknown.png">
                    <h3>
                        Unknown Memory is the closest thing I can imagine 
                        to being trapped in a futuristic fighting video 
                        game from the point of view of an underworld criminal. 
                        The production is electric and Lean’s energy is palpable.
                        <br><br> 
                        This album is best known for the track “Yoshi City,” 
                        and for good reason. Few songs have been ahead of their 
                        time quite like this one. Other highlights include “Ghosttown” 
                        featuring Travi$ Scott from the days where he still sported a 
                        dollar sign in his name, and “Monster”

                    <h3>
                        Poison Ivy is another project on the shorter side, 
                        in which Lean worked closely with producer Whitearmor 
                        to create a gloomy spectacle that evokes images of a 
                        ravaged Yung Lean walking through desolate paths and 
                        post-apocalyptic landscapes. 
                        <br><br>
                        There is certainly a 
                        unique melancholy flavor that is consistent in this 
                        album and displays the growing maturity of Lean as an 
                        artist. The mixtape is consistently gorgeous and feels really revolutionary. 
                        A few personal favorites include the tracks “silicon wings” and “trashy”.
